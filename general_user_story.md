## Title: Jeopardy Study Application

## Priority: High

## Estimate: One (1) day

## User Story

As a general purpose user, I want this application to provide me with an easy-to-use gameplay experience that teaches me fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a user with no programming experience, the game will provide them with an introduction to key concepts of web development using the above-mentioned technologies. If the user can play the game without too much trouble (looking up information is acceptable) and without bugs, then the game will be considered successful.

## Features

The game will track users who register using a form. Their username will be saved alongside any previous game store. The game board will consist of 20 questions displayed as tiles grouped into four categories:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * git (version control)
Answers will be provided once a question is answered. Possible question/answer formats include text, multiple choice, and true/false. A high score ranking list will give users a sense of where their knowledge stands compared to others.
