## Vision

  During computer programming course 201 several different topics are covered at a very rapid pace and at the end of the course is an exam to check student’s learning over the length of the course.  Currently there is no study guide for the exam and leaves students to go find the information from previous readings or to try and remember categories covered.  This product will compile a list of basic concepts covered during the course that may appear on the exam to better focus the student’s pre-exam study.  While the exam is open book, it is also a timed event as well, this product will allow students to answer some of the easier, more direct questions quickly without having to look up every answer allowing more time to look up difficult or tricky questions.
  
  ## Scope In:
  
•	The web app will test user’s knowledge of code 201 level questions over HTML, CSS and JavaScipt

•	The web app will provide the correct answer to the user after an answer has been submitted

•	Users will be able to visually see the number of correct questions they have answered

•	Questions will be ordered by category and difficulty level

## Scope Out

•	This web application will not be designed for mobile devices or other small screens.

## MVP

•	Question is provided based on tile clicked in the game, correct answers are highlighted after user selects an answer, and correct score is tallied.

## Stretch Goals

•	Randomly assign a daily double

•	Adding explanation or definition to explain why an answer is correct

•	90% threshold would allow a user to progress to more difficult questions in a second round.

## Functional Requirements
